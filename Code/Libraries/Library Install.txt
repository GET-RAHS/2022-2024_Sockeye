To install all the libraries:

1: Open Arduino, assuming you have TeensyDuino installed

2: Open File-->Preferences and change your "sketchbook location" to an easily accessible place

3: Go to the location of the newly created sketchbook, and if there's not a folder named "Libraries", make one

4: Download the library zip file from the GitHub library directory, extract it, and manually put all the folders inside the new "Libraries" folder you made in the last step. There is no need to use the Arduino IDE to install the Libraries manually

5: Restart Arduino IDE and upload the code, 

Issues:

1: If there are any missing libraries you should be able to install them from the Arduino IDE Library manager

2: If there are any "Duplicate Libraries" delete ALL your libraries and completely reinstall the libraries, or, go to C:\Users\"username"\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\teensy\hardware\avr\1.59.0\libraries and delete the duplicates. (The file location might be slightly different depending on how you installed Arduino.
